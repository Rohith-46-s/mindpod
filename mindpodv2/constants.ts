export const SAMPLE_STORY = `In the heart of the Whispering Woods, a young fox named Faelan, known for his speed, raced against an old, wise owl named Orin. "Speed is not everything, young one," hooted Orin from a branch above. Faelan just laughed, a streak of red fur against the green moss. "But wisdom doesn’t win races, old friend!" he shouted back, not breaking his stride.

Suddenly, the path split. One way was clear and straight, the other twisted through thorny bushes. Faelan, without a thought, dashed down the clear path. Orin, however, flew towards the thorny way. "The quickest path is not always the fastest," he called out. Faelan was already far ahead and didn't hear.

He soon found his path ending at a wide, impassable river. He had to turn back. As he returned to the fork, he saw Orin waiting for him on the other side of the bushes. The thorny path, it turned out, was a shortcut over a narrow, hidden stone bridge. Faelan sighed, finally understanding. "You're right, Orin. I should have listened." The owl simply nodded. "Wisdom is knowing which path to take. Speed is how you travel it."`;
